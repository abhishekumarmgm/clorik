Helo! This is Abhishek Kumar with my answer to your coding challenge. 

You said:

Create a webpage that displays a gallery of images, given a JSON array
containing a list of image URLs.
Here are the requirements:
• Do not use any Javascript libraries or frameworks for your webpage.
Javascript build tools are ok.
• ES5 or above is preferred.
• The basic layout should be a grid of pictures.
• The images should be reorder-able by dragging and dropping. Dragging
an image to a new position should insert that image at the new position,
and maintain order of other images. It should not swap images.
